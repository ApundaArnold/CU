<p>Lecture 6: Mobile meets computing - Mobile Cloud Computing
Cloud computing (CC) has been widely recognized as the next generation’s computing infrastructure. CC offers some advantages by allowing users to use infrastructure (e.g., servers, networks, and storages), platforms (e.g., middleware services and operating systems), and softwares (e.g., application programs) provided by cloud providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, and Salesforce) at low cost. In addition, CC enables users to elastically utilize resources in an on-demand fashion. As a result, mobile applications can be rapidly provisioned and released with the minimal management efforts or service provider’s interactions.
With the explosion of mobile applications and the support of CC for a variety of services for mobile users, mobile cloud computing (MCC) is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into the mobile environment. Mobile cloud computing brings new types of services and facilities for mobile users to take full advantages of cloud computing.
Definition: Mobile Cloud Computing refers to an infrastructure where both the data storage and the data processing happen outside of the mobile device. Mobile cloud applications move the computing power and data storage away from mobile phones and into the cloud, bringing applications and mobile computing to not just smart-phone users but a much broader range of mobile subscribers.
 Utility computing is the packaging of computing resources, such as computation and storage, as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility 
 A computer cluster is a group of linked computers, working together closely so that in many respects they form a single computer. 
 Grid computing  is the application of several computers to a single problem at the same time — usually to a scientific or technical problem that requires a great number of computer processing cycles or access to large amounts of data 
 Cloud computing is a style of computing in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet. 
MCC is a new paradigm for mobile applications whereby the data processing and storage are moved from the mobile device to powerful and centralized computing platforms located in clouds. These centralized applications are then accessed over the wireless connection based on a thin native client or web browser on the mobile devices.

Architectures of Mobile Cloud Computing
 
Advantages of Mobile Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is known to be a promising solution for mobile computing due to many reasons (e.g.,mobility, communication, and portability)
 Extending battery lifetime:
 Improving data storage capacity and processing power: Storage capacity is also a constraint for mobile devices. MCC is developed to enable mobile users to store/access the large data on the cloud through wireless networks.
 Improving reliability: Storing data or running applications on clouds is an effective way to improve the reliability since the data and application are stored and backed up on a number of computers. This reduces the chance of data and application lost on the mobile devices.
 Dynamic provisioning: Dynamic on-demand provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, self-service basis is a flexible way for service providers and mobile users to run their applications without advanced reservation of resources.
 Scalability: The deployment of mobile applications can be performed and scaled to meet the unpredictable user demands due to flexible resource provisioning. Service providers can easily add and expand an application and service without or with little constraint on the resource usage.
  Multi-tenancy: Service providers (e.g., network operator and data center owner) can share the resources and costs to support a variety of applications and large number of users.
 Ease of Integration: Multiple services from different service providers can be integrated easily through the cloud and the Internet to meet the users’ demands.
Applications of Mobile Cloud Computing
 Mobile Commerce - Mobile commerce (m-commerce) is a business model for commerce using mobile devices. The mcommerce applications generally fulfill some tasks that require mobility (e.g., mobile transactions and payments, mobile messaging, and mobile ticketing).
 Mobile Learning - Mobile learning (m-learning) is designed based on electronic learning (e-learning) and mobility. However, traditional m-learning applications have limitations in terms of high cost of devices and network, low network transmission rate, and limited educational resources. Cloud-based m-learning applications are introduced to solve these limitations. For example, utilizing a cloud with the large storage capacity and powerful processing ability, the applications provide learners with much richer services in terms of data (information) size, faster processing speed, and longer battery life.
 Mobile Healthcare - The purpose of applying MCC in medical applications is to minimize the limitations of traditional medical treatment (e.g., small physical storage, security and privacy, and medical errors). Mobile healthcare (m-healthcare) provides mobile users with convenient helps to access resources (e.g., patient health records) easily and quickly. Besides, m-healthcare offers hospitals and healthcare organizations a variety of on-demand services on clouds rather than owning standalone applications on local servers.
 Mobile Gaming - Mobile game (m-game) is a potential market generating revenues for service providers. M-game can completely offload game engine requiring large computing resource (e.g., graphic rendering) to the server in the cloud, and gamers only interact with the screen interface on their devices.
Issues in Mobile Communication Side
 Low Bandwidth: Bandwidth is one of the big issues in MCC since the radio resource for wireless networks is much scarce as compared with the traditional wired networks.
 Availability: Service availability becomes more important issue in MCC than that in the cloud computing with wired networks. Mobile users may not be able to connect to the cloud to obtain service due to traffic congestion, network failures, and the out-of-signal.
 Heterogeneity: MCC will be used in the highly heterogeneous networks in terms of wireless network interfaces. Different mobile nodes access to the cloud through different radio access technologies such as WCDMA, GPRS, WiMAX, CDMA2000, and WLAN. As a result, an issue of how to handle the wireless connectivity while satisfying MCC’s requirements arises (e.g., always-on connectivity, on-demand scalability of wireless connectivity, and the energy efficiency of mobile devices).
